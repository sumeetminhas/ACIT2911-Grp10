One Stop Bike Shop

One Stop Bike Shop is an e-commerce website that helps a small Vancouver-based business to advertise their vintage, one-of-a-kind products. This app allows the owner of the bike shop to log-in to their personal admin account and advertise their products by uploading photos and descriptions to their online store. Customers are able to view the products and add desired items to their shopping cart. They can edit or delete items within their shopping cart and once satisfied they can proceed to checkout.

We used python, flask, html, css, json, pytest, and heroku to build this app. Flask and python have great libraries and documentation to create ecommerce websites. 

In the future we would like to implement an actual payment stripe service to process a purchase.

This application was made by Sumeet Minhas, Kyla van-Eyden Rasmussen, Yingyi He, and Ramansh Chhabra for our Agile Development class.
